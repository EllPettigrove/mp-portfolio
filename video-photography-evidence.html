            <p>Photography is a very creative subject that is simple once the basics are understood. The main elements of photography are exposure,  focus and composition. Exposure is split into three different things. Aperture, shutter speed and ISO. These three components work hand in hand. Sammon states that aperture is how much the lens opens when taking a photograph. The book also says that shutter speed is how fast the lens opens and closes and that ISO is how sensitive the camera becomes to light.</p>

            <p>Focus can majorly affect where the viewers look towards as it can change both the focal point and the depth of field. Zakia and Page say that the focal point is “wherever the eye is directed to look in a photograph”. The depth of field can be changed by the focus ring and this is important because some images such as portraiture images normally require a shallow depth of field, especially if a lot is going on in the background. In simple terms, this is where the subject in the foreground is in focus, and the background is blurred. A wide depth of field would be where the background is also in focus, changing the picture entirely.</p>

            <p>Composition is important as it determines the things that stand out in an image. For example, leading lines can be used to guide a viewer through an image and tell a story, rather than just looking at a photo for the sake of it. There are many other composition techniques such as the rule of thirds, framing and symmetry.</p>

            <p>I decided to take photographs of modern architecture because it felt relevant as I'm based in a city that is beginning to see a variety of new modern buildings being constructed, and I think the different types of architecture in Manchester allowed me to use a range of composition techniques.</p>

            <h1 class="section-heading">Video Production Basics</h1>


            <p>Similarly to photography, video production requires excellent use and understanding of a camera. Although, video production is arguably more challenging as there are other factors to consider. In addition, we were briefed by MOTDx and had to stick to the guidelines set. Originally, my groups video piece was going to be about football food, however the video was for 16 to 24 year olds, therefore we decided to change the majority of the piece to football shirts and memorabilia as we believed the younger audience would be more interested in that.</p>

            <p>Framing is a huge factor of video production as it can be the reason why somebody chooses to carry on watching or not. The 180 degree rule is pivotal when having more than one person in the video. Vimeo says that “two characters in a scene should always have the same left/right relationship to each other.” For our piece, we used the 180 degree rule multiple times to avoid any disruption and to keep consistent.</p>

            <p>When looking at video production, you also have to make sure that the sound is of a good standard. Making Media states that there are three components of sound design, those being, dialogue, narration and ambience. As a result of this, we had to check that the microphone was working, while also making sure we were in an area with little background noise and that the presenting sounded natural and snappy, as that’s the style of MOTDx.</p>

            <h1 class="section-heading">Social Media Delivery Formats</h1>

            <p>Social media delivery determines how a person views a specific post on social media. For the MOTDx video, we used a behind the scenes blooper for our social media element. This is because we want a young audience to watch the video, and watching somebody do a task incorrectly or make a mistake is usually somewhat amusing to people of the younger generation.</p>

            <p>As well as this, we needed to figure out the correct aspect ratio for this video to be posted. Figma states that aspect ratio describes the width and height of a screen. To give an example of how this would work, a 1:1 aspect ratio is simply a square.  A high definition TV would usually have an aspect ratio of 16:9. However, this can vary due to ultra wide displays. What you see on these TVs is considered broadcast format.</p>

            <p>Social media apps such as Instagram and Facebook use a much smaller aspect ratio, usually 4:3, in order for the content to fit on a user’s phone or tablet. If you used a larger aspect ratio for social media delivery, then the full image of the video simply wouldn’t fit on screen, making it confusing for the audience as there may be things happening that they can’t see.</p>
