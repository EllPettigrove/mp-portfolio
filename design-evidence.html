            <p>Colour theory is one of the most vital parts to be considered when it comes to having a website. This is because colours that don’t work well together will likely put a viewer off of the website without even looking at the content on offer. It is always good to have a strong contrast between colours on a website to make it pleasing to the eye.</p>

            <p>Colour theory is essentially where colours are put into a wheel that begins by the three primary colours, red, yellow and blue. The colour wheel also features three secondary colours and six tertiary colours. It allows people to make different tints and shades of colours. Tints and shades are very similar however a tint is when a colour is mixed with white, making it lighter, and a shade is where a colour is mixed with black, making it darker.</p>

            <p>My website follows a predominantly complementary colour palette. It is full of black and white, along with hints of blue which I think works well because it is visually pleasing and it also links to my photography element due to the photos featuring a lot of blue within them. I also think the colours I’ve used seem modern which is what I want due to my portfolio being about modern architecture. To add to this, Beaird and Walker claim that the colour blue symbolises freedom and imagination, which I feel relates well to media production as it is very creative.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Typography</h2>

            <p>Typography is something that is important for a website as it needs to link with the overall theme. It is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear and aesthetically pleasing to the viewer or reader. For my website, I’ve used fairly basic language so that a large audience can understand what my website is all about.</p>

            <p>The main font I decided to go for was Roboto Slab which is a very square font. The reason why it looks this way is because it is a serif typeface. Wix states that a serif typeface “includes small decorative lines or ‘tails’ on the end of letter strokes.” I used this for both headings and body, however I kept the headings in capital letters to differentiate them from the body areas. I chose this because the shape fits in well with modern buildings and architecture, as well as it being simple to read.</p>

            <p>The reason why I chose not to go with multiple different fonts and text sizes is because I wanted to keep my website consistent. I didn’t want viewers to get overwhelmed or confused. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Accessibility</h2>

            <p>Accessibility is somewhat self explanatory when it comes to websites. It is how easily accessible things are. I have tried to keep my website simple and used things such as alt text to keep it as accessible as possible. For my photography portfolio, I put alt text for every photo. This is where the viewer can read about what the picture is if the picture doesn’t load.</p>

            <p> Accessibility links to both colour theory and typography. My colours have a strong contrast and the text is clear and easy to read, therefore making the website accessible to a wide range of people. The layout of my website is also very clear and concise. My name is in the top right corner to indicate that it is my website, and all the page names are across the top of the screen making it easy to find what you’re looking for. Once you click on a page, the title will appear in large blue font in the centre of the page. I did this so that people don’t accidentally begin scrolling through the incorrect page.</p>

            <p>Beaird and Walker claim that you should always ask yourself what the viewers would be looking for when it comes to layout and accessibility.</p>
